## DNS over HTTPS

**DNS over HTTPS** (**DoH**) is a protocol for performing remote [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) resolution via the [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) protocol. A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks)[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#cite_note-register-1) by using the HTTPS protocol to [encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypt) the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based [DNS resolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_resolver).

## DNS over TLS

**DNS over TLS** (**DoT**) is a [security protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_protocol) for encrypting and wrapping [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) queries and answers via the [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (TLS) protocol. The goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks).
